                    details) with volunteers who apply to your internships and/or positions or get hired by you through<br>
                    SocieTree.</li>

                <li>When we send you an email or SMS, we use a third party service. In this case, it becomes<br> 
                    necessary to pass on your email address/ mobile number to the third party. While we only work<br>
                    with reputed service providers in this regard, we are not responsible for the use made by them of<br>

            section. Certain data (such as applications you may have made) cannot be edited by you. This needs<br>
            to be processed through us.</p>

            <p style="text-align: center;">We and third parties with whom we partner, may use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags etc. to collect<br>
                information regarding your use of SocieTree and third party websites. A cookie is a small text file that <br>
                is stored on your computer that enables us to remember you (for example, as a registered user) and <br>
                your actions when you visit our website. This helps us remember your preferences and searches,<br>
                improve your experience (for example, by keeping you logged in), customize content according to <br>
                your preferences and perform analytics, and assist with security and administrative functions. Cookies <br>
                may be persistent or stored only during an individual session ,as necessary. A pixel tag is a tiny <br>
                graphic with a unique identifier embedded invisibly in an email and may be used to track whether the <br>
                email has been opened and for other analytics.</p>
                       
            <p style="text-align: center;">Most modern browsers will allow you to disable some/all cookies for any website. However, this is not <br>
            recommended and doing so may interfere with normal functioning of SocieTree. If you do not turn <br>
            cookies off, please make sure you logout when you finish using a shared computer.</p>
        <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;text-align: center;">Children</h3>

                However, please note that we have no way of determining your age when you visit our website or <br>
                whether you have parental supervision available or not. We do not intend to and do not knowingly <br>
                collect personal information from children under 13. However, since we do not collect information on a<br> 
                user's birth date and proof of the same, there is no foolproof way for us to ensure the same.</p>
        <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;text-align: center;">Security of information</h3>
            <p style="text-align: center;">While we try our best to safeguard information, there may be factors beyond our control that may<br> 
                result in unwanted disclosure of information. We assume no liability or responsibility for disclosure of <br>
                your information due to causes beyond our control.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">In order to keep personal information secure, you must not share your password or other security <br>
                information (for example, unique keys) of your SocieTree account with anyone. If you are using a <br>
                shared computer, please make sure you logout after every use. If we receive instructions using your <br>
                email and password, we will consider that the instructions have been authorized by you.</p>
        <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;text-align: center;">No Guarantees</h3>         
            <p style="text-align: center;">While this Privacy Policy states our standards for maintenance of data and we will make efforts to <br>
                meet them, we are not in a position to guarantee these standards. There may be factors beyond our <br>
                control that may result in disclosure of data. As a consequence, we disclaim any warranties or <br>
                representations relating to maintenance or nondisclosure of data.</p>
        <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;text-align: center;">Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
